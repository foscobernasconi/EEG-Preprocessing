# EEG-Preprocessing

Matlab functions for preprocessing of electroencephalography (EEG) data.

The functions can be used to import the EEG data into Matlab and run through the most common preprocessing steps (filtering, epoching, etc.). 
Note that the code provided here consists basically of wrapper functions that rely on functions from the EEGLAB toolbox for Matlab
